Oim System Requirements   

The Laravel framework has a few system requirements. All of these requirements are satisfied by the Laravel Homestead virtual machine, so it's highly recommended that you use Homestead as your local Laravel development environment.

However, if you are not using Homestead, you will need to make sure your server meets the following requirements:

- PHP >= 7.1.3
- OpenSSL PHP Extension
- PDO PHP Extension
- Mbstring PHP Extension 
- Tokenizer PHP Extension
- XML PHP Extension
- Ctype PHP Extension
- JSON PHP Extension
- BCMath PHP Extension

In most hosting accounts, these extensions are enabled by default. But you should check with your hosting provider.

After installing Oim School to work properly, you must make a few directories/files writable. Below is a list of directories/files you should ensure have write permissions:

- installation_dir/storage/app/
- installation_dir/storage/framework/cache
- installation_dir/storage/framework/session
- installation_dir/storage/framework/testing
- installation_dir/public/uploads/
